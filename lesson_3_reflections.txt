When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  When I want to share my work with others or have the possibility for others
  to easily contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because someone else might make a change to the remote repository that you
  would likely want to review before adding to your files.
