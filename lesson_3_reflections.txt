When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  When I want to share my work with others or have the possibility for others
  to easily contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because someone else might make a change to the remote repository that you
  would likely want to review before adding to your files.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  Clone copies the contents of a Git repository. Fork also copies a Git
  repository, but within GitHub (i.e., fork copies a repository already on
  GitHub to a new repository on GitHub; with clone you can copy a repository to
  your local machine). A branch occurs within a repository; it enables a
  "new version" of the code while leaving intact versions already in the
  repository.
